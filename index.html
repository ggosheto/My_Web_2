    <h2>What is Digital Minimalism?</h2>
    <p>
      Digital minimalism is the practice of intentionally simplifying your digital life by reducing unnecessary screen time, notifications, and tech distractions.
    </p>

    <h2>Why It Matters More Than Ever</h2>
    <p>
      In 2025, we are surrounded by smart devices, AI feeds, and hyper-targeted content. Without boundaries, our minds are fragmented, attention spans shrink, and our well-being suffers.
    </p>

    <h2>Tips to Start</h2>
    <button id="toggleTips">Show Tips</button>
    <ul id="tipsList" style="display: none;">
      <li>Turn off non-essential notifications</li>
      <li>Uninstall apps that don’t serve a clear purpose</li>
      <li>Schedule screen-free time daily</li>
      <li>Use tools like Focus Mode or grayscale</li>
      <li>Spend more time offline — reading, walking, or just being</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thought</h2>
    <p>
      Technology should serve you — not the other way around. Consider what you really value, and curate your digital life accordingly.
